# About
My first project using C++. This project is assigned to me during my semester 1 in UiTM Raub. 
In this project, I've used basic elements, input/output, and functions. 
There are 4 functions which is inputData(), calcBasicCharge(), calcAddService(), displayReceipt(), and main(). 

# How does it work?
Customers be able to enter their ID, their status, weight of fabric and additional service through inputData() function.
Then, calcBasicCharge() function will calculate the total payment based on the weight of fabric.
Next, calcAddService() functino will calculate the additional service that they desired.
Afterwards, the system will display the receipt using displayReceipt() function.
Finally, main() function will call all the functions above. It will ask if there is additional customer to add. The function will also display total of customers and total charge given to all of the customer in the session.
