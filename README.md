# About
My first project using C++. This project is assigned to me during my semester 1 in UiTM Raub. 
In this project, I've used basic elements, input/output, and functions. 
There are 3 functions which is inputData(), calcBasicCharge(), calcAddService() and displayReceipt(). 

# How does it work?
Customers be able to enter their ID, their status, weight of fabric and additional service through inputData() function.
Then, calcBasicCharge() function will calculate the total payment based on the weight of fabric.
Next, calcAddService() functino will calculate the additional service that they desired.
Finally, the system will display the receipt using displayReceipt() function.
