# Rotan-Tunggal-Fabric-Folding-Service
My first project using C++. This project is assigned to me during my semester 1 in UiTM Raub. 
In this project, I've used basic elements, input/output, and functions. 
There are 3 functions which is inputData(), calcBasicCharge(), calcAddService() and displayReceipt(). 

# How does it work?
Customers be able to enter their ID, their status, weight of fabric and additional service. The system will calculate the total payment based on the weight of fabric and additional service that they desired.
